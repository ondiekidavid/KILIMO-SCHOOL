I created database that is multitenant in nature that prompted me to add two more tables called Branch and company tables

Inplemented all security features like.

User logs table
Data changes update table.
Data is not deleted permanently but set to inactive state which users can access apart from admin

The database can perform the following.
1.Capture all classes
2.View Class streams
3.Capture student Data and assign a student to a particular class stream
4.View a single class stream
5.Edit student and stream data
6.Delete student data
7.View a single student data
8.view all student data
9.view student that belong to a particular class stream

I also created API.

It was incomplete because of the heavy workload.
But I have a full system that I can share with you that has both DB API and UI
